                <h2>Early History</h2>
                <p>Korea’s history dates back thousands of years, with early kingdoms like Gojoseon forming around 2333 BCE. Later, the Three Kingdoms period (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) shaped the foundation of Korean culture and society. Buddhism and Confucianism began influencing Korean life during this time.</p>

                <h2>Unified Silla and Goryeo Dynasty</h2>
                <p>In 668 CE, the Silla kingdom unified much of the Korean Peninsula. This was followed by the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392), which gave Korea its name in the West and developed a rich culture, including celadon pottery and the invention of movable metal type printing.</p>

                <h2>Joseon Dynasty</h2>
                <p>The Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897) was a long-lasting kingdom that emphasized Confucian values. During this time, Hangul, the Korean alphabet, was created by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century, helping literacy spread across the country.</p>

                <h2>20th Century and Japanese Occupation</h2>
                <p>Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910, leading to harsh rule and resistance movements. After World War II, Korea was liberated in 1945 but divided into North Korea and South Korea, leading to the Korean War (1950–1953).</p>

                <h2>Modern South Korea</h2>
                <p>South Korea became a democratic republic and experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth, becoming a leading technology and cultural powerhouse. Today, it is known worldwide for K-pop, technology, and rich cultural heritage.</p>
